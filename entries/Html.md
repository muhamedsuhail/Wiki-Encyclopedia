# HTML

---
## **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 

It can be assisted by technologies such as [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](/wiki/Css) and scripting languages such as [JavaScript](/wiki/Javascript) and [VBScript](/wiki/Vbscript).

>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
>
>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
