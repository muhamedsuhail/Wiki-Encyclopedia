# Git

---
**Git** is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 

It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 

Its goals include 

*	speed
*	data integrity
*	and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

>Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development
